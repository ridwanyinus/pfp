        Iâ€™m Ridwan, a passionate Nigerian front-end developer and graphic designer. I specialize in using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to create user-friendly, responsive web applications. For
        graphics, I use Illustrator and Photoshop. <br /> Beyond coding, I enjoy playing chess, watching football, immersing myself in movies and series, listening to music, and diving into
        captivating books. These interests enhance my creativity and technical skills. <br /> As a developer and designer, I create beautiful, functional interfaces. I excel in group settings,
        coordinating closely with project managers, back-end developers, and designers to produce high-quality digital solutions. My attention to detail and problem-solving skills enable me to
        troubleshoot issues and implement effective solutions.
